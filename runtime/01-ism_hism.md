# ISM or HISM

::: tip
Use <b>ISM</b> instead of HISM on engine version 5.4 and above, as it supports LODs just as well and provides better performance.
:::

Use **VertexAnimationISM** or **VertexAnimationHISM** component instead of InstancedStaticMesh or HierarchicalInstancedStaticMesh.<br>
These will automatically update vectors needed for anti-aliasing to work properly.
