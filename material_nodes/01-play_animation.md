<hr>

## Inputs

==- Time
Connect this if you want to control the animation time yourself. <br/>
By default, it is set to Time node multiplied by 30. <br/>
You should use this pin if you want to control the speed of your animation.
===

==- Vertex Position Texture
This is the pin to which you should connect your generated position texture array.
===

==- Vertex Normal Texture
This is the pin to which you should connect your generated normal texture array.
===

==- Start Frame
Frame index from which your animation will start.
===

==- End Frame
Frame index where your animation stops or loops.
===

==- Max Frames
You need to set this to total frames of your animation.
===

==- Tangent Space Normals

!!!
If disabled, make sure to disable them inside material properties.
!!!

By default this is <b>True</b> because it allows blending normals. But tangent space normals can sometimes produce artifacts, so you can turn it off. <br/>
===

==- Play Once
Set this to <b>True</b> if you want your animation to stop at the last frame (End Frame). <br/>
===

<hr>

## Outputs

==- Normal
Returns calculated normals from your textures, connect this to your material normal pin. <br/>

::: tip
If your model already uses a normal map, you can use <b>BlendAngleCorrectedNormals</b> node.
:::
===

==- World Position Offset
Returns calculated position offsets from your texture, connect this to your material <b>World Position Offset</b> pin. <br/>
===

==- Custom UV 2

!!!
Make sure <b>Num Customized UVs</b> is set to <b>4</b>
!!!

Connect this to <b>Customized UV2</b> pin.
===

==- Custom UV 3
